Hey everyone!

It's been well over a month since I've provided an [update on D3Up.com](http://d3up.com), so I figured I'd take a moment to go over what's changed. I'm still working away on some new features, which I hope to have ready either late this year or sometime in early January.

Since it always gets asked, ***"What's D3Up?"***, here's a fast answer:

> D3Up is a gear simulator, DPS/EHP calculator and set of tools to help you optimize your Diablo 3 Characters. 

> [I'd recommend watching this video where I go over the basics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaRts-nmOE8)

Few quick notes (kinda TL;DR):

- /r/d3up exists now, cmon over and chat!
- **Group Buffs** - You can now activate all group buffs to see what other classes buffs do for you.
- **Skill Catalog** - Shows a bunch of skills that you could use, with some stats on them.
- **Build Groups** exist now, you can [create groups](http://d3up.com/group/create) to create groups, then add builds into them or make it an "Open Group" and others can join. All it does it puts all the builds on a page together for easy sharing.

**Onto the patch notes!**

General
---
- Added a link to [/r/d3up](http://reddit.com/r/d3up), which is D3Up's new Subreddit. Feel free to use it to talk, report bugs, request features, whatever!
- Removed the ItemDB portion of the site, it wasn't that useful and helps performance to not have Google crawling 5k+ pages of items every day.  		
- Added a favicon!

All Builds / Characters
---
- The Importer now detects "Hidden" affixes on items and will properly add them to items. This happened a lot on Jewelry that has a "+X-Y Damage" when it rolls an additional "+Min" or "+Max" damage. The +Min/+Max extra affix doesn't show on the tooltip, but now shows on D3Up.
- Experimenting with a new "Build Group" feature, which lets [you create a group](http://d3up.com/group/create) and then add builds to it. It's useful for grouping a bunch of builds together, maybe to [show your Twitch Team](http://d3up.com/group/2) or the [/r/diablo Players](http://d3up.com/group/3).
- Added a new tab, called *Group Buffs*. This tab lets you activate buffs that other players could give your character if they were in your game.
- Skill Catalog - All builds now have an experimental "Skill Catalog", which gives a brief overview of all of your DPS skills (without Cooldown).
- When changing skills/passives	all of your enabled skills/passives will be disabled until you activate them again. This is to prevent a bug where you could activate a skill then change that skill and the benefits of that skill would remain.
- Corrected Duel-Wield math that has probably be incorrect for a long time.
- Reduced the time of crawls for registered users to 2 minutes.
- Revamped the Sync from Battle.net, which now saves all of your character stats to the DB when you sync. These stats can now be accessed via JSON [if you add /json onto the end of your build URL](http://d3up.com/b/1/json).

Statistics (Sidebar)
---
- Added IAS to the Damage Stats (along with bonuses from DW).
- Added DPS vs Demons to Statistics.			
- Arcane/Holy EHP no longer displays Poison EHP.	
- Fix to attack speed display.	
- Added "Damage Range" section showing the true damage of your weapons. 
- Fixed Ranged EHP calculations to use the right math :P	
- Added HP:EHP Ratio to the sidebar.

Item Simulation / Compare
---
- Added a percentage change to the "Diff" window.
- Fix for disappearing compare window.			
- Added larger EHP/DPS numbers to the compares.			
- You can now change the set the item belongs to in the simulate.
- Fixed a bug preventing you from editing set items.

Skills Tab
---
- Normalized Weapon Damage for skills with Cooldowns. This corrected a lot of skill DPS for skills that factor in your attack speed (when normally they wouldn't).
- Massive improvements to many skills in the "Skills" tab on all builds.
- Skills now show damage types and proc coefficients.
- Any bonuses from Items that affect a specific skills DPS are now factored into the Skills Damage display.
- Added estimated "Resources per Second" (RPS) for each skill estimating the amount of resources that the skill will return. 
- Added average "Life Steal" per hit.
- Added estimated "Life on Hit" value using the proc coefficient.
- Added experimental "Life per Second" (LPS) for each skill estimating the amount of life returned from all life regen stats against a single target (LoH, LS & Life Regen). 

Barbarian 
---
- Whirlwind/RltW - Added tDPS (Tornado DPS) based on [this thread](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/6864416737).
- Whirlwind/RltW - Added Tick Rate to statistics sidebar for how often your Tornado's "Tick"
- Weapons Master fury generation is now included in the RPS on skills.
- Unforgiving and No Escape are now included in the RPS on skills.

- Way of the Hundred Fists - Windforce Fury - Fixed the Weapon Damage calculations.
- Mantra of Evasion - Added a "stack" select box to the skill that lets you change whether it's the effect for the first 3 seconds or the normal duration. 1 stack = Normal Effect, 2 stack = 3 second effect.
- Sixth Sense / Guardians Path - Fixed Dodge calculations from these skills to accurately show dodge percentages.
