I'll try to do this with all major updates, but I'll keep the simple bug fix stuff to strictly on <a href=\"http://d3up.com/updates\">D3Up.com's Updates page</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So, without further ado, I present to you the feature updates from what I'm calling <strong><em>Update #10</em></strong>, exciting huh?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Item Search</strong></p>\n\n<p>I played with a lot of interfaces for displaying item information, and I think that this is probably the best I so far. On the <a href=\"http://d3up.com/items\">Item's Page</a>, the database lists the most recently created items until you start playing with filters. I haven't quite found a home for all the filters yet, so you'll notice they're just kinda splattered on the top of the table. Let's start with what the different filters do:</p>\n\n<ul><li><em>Filter by Item Type</em>: This filter lets you search for specific types of items, like \"Two Handed Mace\" or \"Wizard Hat\". </li>\n<li><em>Filter by Slot</em>: This filter lets you search for things that fit into a specific slot, so searching for \"Helm\" will return Helmets, Wizard Hats, Spirit Stones and Voodoo Masks. I've still got some work to do on this one, the one thing that bugs me right now is searching for \"Main Hand\" returns all 2H weapons and 1H weapons, and searching \"Off Hand\" returns all 1H weapons that can be dual-wielded as well as all shields, mojos, quivers and sources. </li>\n<li><em>Filter &amp; Sort by Multiple Stats</em>: This is the beast of a field, it does all of your heavy lifting, however can be a bit confusing. Every stat in the database can be loaded into this field, and it will order all of the items in the database in the order you enter them. The stats you enter will be pushed to the left and highlighted green for ease of comparing. For example, if you pick \"Resist All\", \"Intelligence\", \"Vitality\" (in that order), it will find all items with those 3 attributes, sort them by \"Resist All\" first, then \"Intelligence\", then finally \"Vitality\". An item with 70 Resist All / 30 Int will show up above a 69 Resist All / 150 Int item. Here's a <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/0Q2q2H1l0X3A\">screenshot of this search</a> to illustrate how it looks. If Int is more important to you than resist all, then put Int before Resist All and it will resort them. </li>\n</ul><p>Under all of the filters, I build the pagination (pages) system into the header of the table as well and tried to make it look a bit less like shit, though I'll admit, I'm no designer. </p>\n\n<p>Now, one last filter, and this one is for <strong>logged in users only</strong>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Compare Items against Build</strong> Filter</p>\n\n<p>This one's a massive feature and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. As I explain it, the links in here are going to be screenshots/d3up links to help illustrate the process. </p>\n\n<p>Let's say you're looking through all the items other users have created and are looking for a new helm. I'm going to use <a href=\"http://d3up.com/b/2\">my build</a> as an example. So, I load up the <a href=\"http://d3up.com/items\">item page</a> and set my <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/2Q0p0b1X3447\">Wizard Tank build as the \"Compared Build\"</a>. Now I'm going to pick \"Helm\" as the Slot Filter and Armor, Resist All, Int and Crit as my stats, <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/1X0U1M0T1R0V\">which pulls up these results</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Alright, those helmets are pretty hot, albeit some of them are probably fake. The <a href=\"http://local.d3up.com/i/6806\">Tenacious Helmet</a> looks good, I'll use that as my comparison. Now, in the previous version of the site, to compare it with my gear, I'd have to \"Copy\" the item into my items, head on over to my build, click compare, pick helmet, and select the new helmet I just copied to see the stat difference. <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/2m33150T0o0R\">Here's what it looks like on the 'Compare' tab of my profile</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That's a shitload of work to figure out how good that helmet would be for me. So I decided we needed a \"Compare\" button, which I'm sure you've noticed in some of the previous screenshots. Let's click it, and on the items page, <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/13021l3V3i1M\">this is what happens</a>. It does the item comparison against whatever the build you selected is currently wearing in that slot right on the page!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Oh, what happens if you compare an item that you are wearing two of, like a ring?\" said you</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've got you covered, it <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/3K333h1a0I16\">will compare all slots that it could currently fit</a> on your selected build. Obviously there's a styling issue there that I have yet to deal with, but it's still useful!</p>\n\n<p>So that about sums that up, I hope you find the new compare tool useful. I plan on implementing the same functionality on all of the item pages too, so you could be looking at an item and click \"Compare with build XXXX\". </p>\n\n<p>Before I get to the patch notes, I'll leave you with a sneak peak at where I'm going from here. </p>\n\n<ul><li>Skills / Actual DPS Calculations: Still working on getting all 8 billion skills into a compatible format, coming soon. </li>\n<li>Auction Tracking: I'm sick of selling items on the AH and not knowing the stats of items that I sold and for how much. I'm nearing completion of a tool that will let you say \"I posted this item on the AH for this much\", and when the sale completes/doesnt, will let you record the outcome of the sale for historical tracking. </li>\n<li>Item Selling: I'm also sick of having all 10 of my Gold AH and all 10 of my RMAH slots full all the time. I still have 2 tabs full of items I want to sell! So I'm going to be building a marketplace that lets you put up items for sale. To start with, it will be a \"Flat Price\" or \"Buyout Only\" marketplace. Obviously it's out of game, so you'll have to coordinate/trade with the buyer/seller of the item, but I have a \"Rating\" system coming along nicely that you'll be able to rate a buyer/seller (think eBay seller rating). I don't want people getting scammed using the marketplace, but I do want to create a place you can list all your excess items and say \"Anyone want to buy these?\". </li>\n</ul><p>Those features are actively being developed and I'll be sure to post some updates when they become available. </p>\n\n<p>Onto the minor site updates!</p>\n\n<ul><li>Fixed a bug with Demon Hunters crashing the DPS Calculator if you picked your skills before equipping gear.</li>\n<li>Fixed a few skill bugs in the DPS Calculator.</li>\n<li>Tons of UI Improvements (Navigation, Data Tables, etc)</li>\n</ul>", "id" : 9, "profile" : { "$ref" : "users", "$id" : { "$oid" : "4fe8ccb617bbcbdd59000dfe" } }, "source" : "It's been a while since my last update, mainly because I wanted to get these new features working before I started talking about them.

If Int is more important to you than resist all, then put Int before Resist All and it will resort them. \r\n\r\nUnder all of the filters, I build the pagination (pages) system into the header of the table as well and tried to make it look a bit less like shit, though I'll admit, I'm no designer. \r\n\r\nNow, one last filter, and this one is for **logged in users only**. \r\n\r\n**Compare Items against Build** Filter\r\n\r\nThis one's a massive feature and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. As I explain it, the links in here are going to be screenshots/d3up links to help illustrate the process. \r\n\r\nLet's say you're looking through all the items other users have created and are looking for a new helm. I'm going to use [my build](http://d3up.com/b/2) as an example. So, I load up the [item page](http://d3up.com/items) and set my [Wizard Tank build as the \"Compared Build\"](http://cl.ly/image/2Q0p0b1X3447). Now I'm going to pick \"Helm\" as the Slot Filter and Armor, Resist All, Int and Crit as my stats, [which pulls up these results](http://cl.ly/image/1X0U1M0T1R0V). \r\n\r\nAlright, those helmets are pretty hot, albeit some of them are probably fake. The [Tenacious Helmet](http://local.d3up.com/i/6806) looks good, I'll use that as my comparison. Now, in the previous version of the site, to compare it with my gear, I'd have to \"Copy\" the item into my items, head on over to my build, click compare, pick helmet, and select the new helmet I just copied to see the stat difference. [Here's what it looks like on the 'Compare' tab of my profile](http://cl.ly/image/2m33150T0o0R).\r\n\r\nThat's a shitload of work to figure out how good that helmet would be for me. So I decided we needed a \"Compare\" button, which I'm sure you've noticed in some of the previous screenshots. Let's click it, and on the items page, [this is what happens](http://cl.ly/image/13021l3V3i1M). It does the item comparison against whatever the build you selected is currently wearing in that slot right on the page!\r\n\r\n> \"Oh, what happens if you compare an item that you are wearing two of, like a ring?\" said you\r\n\r\nI've got you covered, it [will compare all slots that it could currently fit](http://cl.ly/image/3K333h1a0I16) on your selected build. Obviously there's a styling issue there that I have yet to deal with, but it's still useful!\r\n\r\nSo that about sums that up, I hope you find the new compare tool useful. I plan on implementing the same functionality on all of the item pages too, so you could be looking at an item and click \"Compare with build XXXX\". \r\n\r\nBefore I get to the patch notes, I'll leave you with a sneak peak at where I'm going from here. \r\n\r\n- Skills / Actual DPS Calculations: Still working on getting all 8 billion skills into a compatible format, coming soon. \r\n- Auction Tracking: I'm sick of selling items on the AH and not knowing the stats of items that I sold and for how much. I'm nearing completion of a tool that will let you say \"I posted this item on the AH for this much\", and when the sale completes/doesnt, will let you record the outcome of the sale for historical tracking. \r\n- Item Selling: I'm also sick of having all 10 of my Gold AH and all 10 of my RMAH slots full all the time. I still have 2 tabs full of items I want to sell! So I'm going to be building a marketplace that lets you put up items for sale. To start with, it will be a \"Flat Price\" or \"Buyout Only\" marketplace. Obviously it's out of game, so you'll have to coordinate/trade with the buyer/seller of the item, but I have a \"Rating\" system coming along nicely that you'll be able to rate a buyer/seller (think eBay seller rating). I don't want people getting scammed using the marketplace, but I do want to create a place you can list all your excess items and say \"Anyone want to buy these?\". \r\n\r\nThose features are actively being developed and I'll be sure to post some updates when they become available. \r\n\r\nOnto the minor site updates!\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug with Demon Hunters crashing the DPS Calculator if you picked your skills before equipping gear.\r\n- Fixed a few skill bugs in the DPS Calculator.\r\n- Tons of UI Improvements (Navigation, Data Tables, etc)", "version" : "10 - Inline Gear Compare" }

{ "_created" : 1343264383, "_id" : { "$oid" : "5010967e17bbcb4b5b0006ba" }, "_type" : "update", "_updated" : 1343265543, "body" : "<p>I don't think I've been as excited for a feature since I originally released the build calculator itself! In all of your builds, you now have a new tab called 'Simulate Item'. I wanted to make comparing items easier on you and prevent you from having to create a ton of extra items to see what they'd do to your stats (like, while browsing the AH). This tool is designed to do just that.</p>\n\n<p>If you only take one thing away from this post, <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/1a3a191A0A37\">let it be this screenshot</a> of live changes in the calculator as you tweak an item.</p>\n\n<p>This update also adds a \"DPS Contributions from Gear\" section, an update to the shops that allows Expense reporting, a complete rebuild of the Build Calculator (from scratch) and many bug fixes. I will note, with the complete revamp of the build calculator, I probably introduced a bunch of new bugs as well, so if you find something that's off, please provide a link to your build and a screenshot of your detailed character statistics so I have something to compare to.  </p>\n\n<h2>Builds - Item Simulator</h2>\n\n<p>The idea originally started with <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wpi31/item_searches_inline_gear_comparisons_ui/c5fluem\">this comment by d0tn3t</a> on one of my last posts about D3Up. Awesome idea, hopefully awesome implementation, just wanted to give some credit out for coming up with the idea!</p>\n\n<p>To find the Item Simulator, head on over to your build and hit the \"Simulate Item\" tab. Next, select which slot this item is going to be simulating/replacing. You'll notice when you select a slot, it automatically loads the item you currently have equipped into an item editor directly on the page (<a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/1H0Z1d2C1B2g\">that looks like this</a>). It works very similar to the item creation tool; you can use the tagger to add new attributes or remove existing ones. When you want to change the actual values, simply change them in the text box in the fake tooltip below. </p>\n\n<p>Now, when you actually change values in the tooltip, your character profile will dynamically update with the new calculations in your Stats/EHP/DPS tabs and below the tooltip a table of stats that have changed will appear. These changes are NOT saved to the item, they are just run through the calculator to show you what effect these changes would have on your character.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, I'm going to change <a href=\"http://d3up.com/i/19\">my helmet</a>(598 armor, 34 str, 172 int, 58 resist all, 9ap/crit) to have 50 more int and +3% crit. Here's a <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/0L2O2e1k0T1U\">screenshot showing the changes</a>. It calculated the +50 int and +3% crit changes, as well as a 4.5 gain in Resist All (from the Int), ~1400 EHP Gain (again, the Int) and a 1,244 gain in DPS (from the Int and Crit). </p>\n\n<p>I can't guarantee 100% accuracy yet in the new build calculator yet, I only have a Wizard and a Barbarian to test against. So if you find something that isn't accurate or true, please let me know with a link and a screenshot of your stats. I do realize the DPS calculations are still like 0.1% off, I'll be looking into that again soon. </p>\n\n<h2>Builds - DPS Contributions from Gear</h2>\n\n<p>You know that tab called \"DPS\" on all the builds that has been empty since the dawn of time? Well, it's got something in it now! This tool was designed to help you figure out which of your pieces of gear aren't helping your DPS as much.

In all of your builds, you now have a new tab called 'Simulate Item'. I wanted to make comparing items easier on you and prevent you from having to create a ton of extra items to see what they'd do to your stats (like, while browsing the AH). This tool is designed to do just that.\r\n\r\nIf you only take one thing away from this post, [let it be this screenshot](http://cl.ly/image/1a3a191A0A37) of live changes in the calculator as you tweak an item.\r\n\r\nThis update also adds a \"DPS Contributions from Gear\" section, an update to the shops that allows Expense reporting, a complete rebuild of the Build Calculator (from scratch) and many bug fixes. I will note, with the complete revamp of the build calculator, I probably introduced a bunch of new bugs as well, so if you find something that's off, please provide a link to your build and a screenshot of your detailed character statistics so I have something to compare to.  \r\n\r\nBuilds - Item Simulator\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe idea originally started with [this comment by d0tn3t](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wpi31/item_searches_inline_gear_comparisons_ui/c5fluem) on one of my last posts about D3Up. Awesome idea, hopefully awesome implementation, just wanted to give some credit out for coming up with the idea!\r\n\r\nTo find the Item Simulator, head on over to your build and hit the \"Simulate Item\" tab. Next, select which slot this item is going to be simulating/replacing. You'll notice when you select a slot, it automatically loads the item you currently have equipped into an item editor directly on the page ([that looks like this](http://cl.ly/image/1H0Z1d2C1B2g)). It works very similar to the item creation tool; you can use the tagger to add new attributes or remove existing ones. When you want to change the actual values, simply change them in the text box in the fake tooltip below. \r\n\r\nNow, when you actually change values in the tooltip, your character profile will dynamically update with the new calculations in your Stats/EHP/DPS tabs and below the tooltip a table of stats that have changed will appear. These changes are NOT saved to the item, they are just run through the calculator to show you what effect these changes would have on your character.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I'm going to change [my helmet](http://d3up.com/i/19)(598 armor, 34 str, 172 int, 58 resist all, 9ap/crit) to have 50 more int and +3% crit. Here's a [screenshot showing the changes](http://cl.ly/image/0L2O2e1k0T1U). It calculated the +50 int and +3% crit changes, as well as a 4.5 gain in Resist All (from the Int), ~1400 EHP Gain (again, the Int) and a 1,244 gain in DPS (from the Int and Crit). \r\n\r\nI can't guarantee 100% accuracy yet in the new build calculator yet, I only have a Wizard and a Barbarian to test against. So if you find something that isn't accurate or true, please let me know with a link and a screenshot of your stats. I do realize the DPS calculations are still like 0.1% off, I'll be looking into that again soon. \r\n\r\nBuilds - DPS Contributions from Gear\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou know that tab called \"DPS\" on all the builds that has been empty since the dawn of time? Well, it's got something in it now! This tool was designed to help you figure out which of your pieces of gear aren't helping your DPS as much. It works just like the EHP/Gear calculations from the last update, it calculates what you would lose by removing that piece of gear from your character. \r\n\r\nMy Shop - Expense Tracking\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've added a super generic expense tracker onto the My Shop section of the site, you can use it to record crafting expenses. I for one am a huge crafter, I'll sit down and make 300-500 pieces of gear at a time. I wanted a way to record how much money I spent on crafting materials and expenses each day so I could compare that against my total sales. \r\n\r\nYour summary tab will also now track how much you had in expenses each day, and the red bar on the side will tell you how much of your profit you re-spent that day on expenses.\r\n\r\nSome Bug Fixes\r\n---\r\n\r\n- When you \"Complete\" a sale (as sold) the item will be unassociated from your profile. This was done to prevent tons of unwanted items from appearing in your \"My Items\" section. Unfortunately, this is from here on out, and not retroactive.\r\n- The dropdown containing all of your items to sell is now in alphabetical order.\r\n- Fixed another bug with copying a Build.\r\n\r\nPrevious Updates\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [#1 - Ready for Testers](http://reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/vpetk/ready_for_testers_item_comparison_character/)\r\n- [#2 - Build Sharing, EHP Calculations](http://reddit.com/r/Diablo3Strategy/comments/waj9f/gear_comparison_build_sharing_damage_calc_eph_and/)\r\n- [#3 - Inline Gear Compare and Item Searching](http://reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wpi31/item_searches_inline_gear_comparisons_ui/)\r\n- [#4 - Recording Item Sales History](http://reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wtymb/a_tool_to_record_your_ah_sales_history_then/)\r\n- [#5 - Skills on Builds, \"Perfection Ratings\" on Items, new personal Sales Statistics tab](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/x1sl4/skills_on_builds_perfection_ratings_on_items_new/)\r\n", "version" : "16 - Item Simulator" }

I'm also going to start off by stating that there <strong>ARE GOING TO BE BUGS</strong> with the skills as well as probably in the calculator due to this update. I've spend a couple hours testing against various/random builds on the site, and I've corrected as many as I can myself.</p>\n\n<p>If you happen upon a bug, I've added a new \"Feedback Widget\" on the right side of <a href=\"http://d3up.com\">D3Up.com</a> that you can now use to communicate bugs, suggestions and ideas.

Not all calculations for skills are going to be accurate immediately, so please report any issues. </p>\n\n<p>One of the things I wanted to originally do with D3Up was create a system that would allow you to actually see the damage your abilities do, with everything factored in. Seeing \"210% Weapon Damage\" on a tooltip doesn't really tell you how much it's going to do, so the Skills tab on every build will now do just that. </p>\n\n<p>Every single skill the creator has picked will now do one of two things:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Display the DPS/Damage that the skill will do with your current gear/passives and other active skills. </li>\n<li>Display the Effect of the Skill and show an \"Activate\" checkbox that lets you turn that skill on or off, modifying your entire build to provide the buffs that the skill gives. </li>\n</ul><p>I'm going to use <a href=\"http://d3up.com/b/2\">my out of date wizard build</a> as the example in explaining everything.</p>\n\n<p>First off, here's a <a href=\"http://cl.ly/image/3d3D3z2W2E3I\">screenshot illustrating two DPS Skills and a Buff Skill I can activate</a>. You'll notice a few things: </p>\n\n<ul><li>Magic Missile is a direct damage ability, it displays your DPS if you were to spam it (factoring in your attack speed), your average hit, and it's normal and crit damage ranges.</li>\n<li>Energy Twister is a DOT type ability, so it's going to show off how much DPS it does, the normal and crit damage range for each tick, and your average tick. </li>\n<li>Energy Armor is a buff, it doesn't show anything special, but has a checkbox in the upper right corner that you can click to activate the buff itself. Once activated, it will apply all of its buff effects to your entire build. The stats panel will change to reflect the buff and any skills it will effect will also update. </li>\n</ul><p>This allows you to see what the skills the player has chosen actually do to the overall build and stats. Your EHP, DPS, and everything else dynamically change to fit the abilities selected and active. </p>\n\n<p>As I said, it's not perfect and there was no way I could possibly check every single combination of skills. So if you find something, hit the feedback button and let me know! I'm assuming that there will be a flood of feedback, and I'll do my best to stay on top and fix them all, but it might take a couple days for me to get around to fixing everything submitted.</p>\n\n<h2>Build Views and Voting</h2>\n\n<p>Browsing builds on D3Up has been pretty popular, so I wanted to add some mechanics to help the good builds float to the top and gain more exposure! I revamped the bar at the top of the builds, reduced the size of the skills and added in some voting controls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Views</strong> are dynamically updated and logged, you can't simply refresh the page in order to up the view count. Each view of the build is logged and calculated to prevent people from artificially inflating the view number. </p>\n\n<p>For <strong>voting</strong>, you <strong>must be logged in to vote</strong>. The mechanics of voting are a lot simpler on my end by requiring the user to be logged in. You are allowed to up vote or down vote on a build, which will either +1 the score or -1 the score, and you can change your vote at any time. If you find a build helpful, awesome or useful, give it an up vote. If a build you found is full of garbage, spam or just not useful at all, down vote it!</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully by allowing everyone to vote on things and by tracking views, as a community, we can let the best builds float to the surface and help new players find useful information. Feel free to post your link to D3Up on your blog and spread the word about your build to get some extra votes/views!</p>\n\n<h2>Build Browsing Improved</h2>\n\n<p>With votes and views implemented now, I decided to revamp the Build List page a bit as well. You can now sort the builds based on what you are looking for. The following columns are now sortable:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Views</li>\n<li>Votes</li>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>DPS</li>\n<li>EHP</li>\n</ul><p>I also removed the \"Geared\" filter, as now builds that aren't geared up won't show up in the list. Why would you want to see a build that isn't complete? That's my train of thought. </p>\n\n<p>The skills displayed on the build page are also now tooltip'd, you can hover over them to see what they are.</p>\n\n<h2>Coming Soon - Open Source DPS/EHP Calculator</h2>\n\n<p>I'm working hard at cleaning up the crappy code in the DPS/EHP Calculator and plan on making it open source and available to anyone that wants to use it. I figure by doing this, it will improve the quality/accuracy of the calculations and allow other sites to use it!</p>\n\n<p>Few things about the calculator itself:</p>\n\n<ul><li>It's written purely in Javascript.</li>\n<li>Currently, it uses underscore.js as it's only dependancy.</li>\n<li>The calculator returns a JS Object containing all of the stats for a build.</li>\n<li>You can pass gear into the calculator in a JSON format.</li>\n<li>The compare tool is integrated into the calculator.</li>\n<li>The code is marked up with more comments than code, to help explain what's going on everywhere.</li>\n<li>I'm not JS Expert, so there's bound to be some \"wtf was he doing here?\" moments.</li>\n</ul><p>I'm not done cleaning it up 100% yet, there's still some sections I want to rewrite before I release it. After the initial wave of bugs and fixing that will go into the Skills Calculator, I plan on returning and finishing the DPS/EHP Calculator and releasing it on github. </p>\n\n<h2>Feedback Widget</h2>\n\n<p>On the right side of the page I've added a feedback button. Clicking on it will open up a window that lets you do a few things:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Submit Ideas/Bugs/Feedback</li>\n<li>View other peoples Ideas/Bugs/Feedback (and vote on them if you like them!)</li>\n<li>Comment on Ideas/Bugs</li>\n</ul><p>I figure it's a nice way for everyone to submit feedback in one place and help me prioritize what needs to be done!</p>\n\n<h2>In Closing</h2>\n\n<p>I think that's about all I've got for you today. I'm pretty dedicated to the site and hope you are too. I've got a mile long list of things people have requested and things I've considered doing, so there's plenty more updates to come. </p>\n\n<p>As I've always said, feel free to reach out to me and let me know what you think, what you want, and how as a community we can improve the site and Diablo 3!</p>\n\n<p>PS - Think I can claim the title of \"Most Advanced DPS Calculator\" yet? :)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n", "id" : 22, "profile" : { "$ref" : "users", "$id" : { "$oid" : "4fe8ccb617bbcbdd59000dfe" } }, "source" : "I've just deployed a major update to [D3Up.com](http://d3up.com), hopefully by reading through this, you'll understand why there hasn't been an update in well over a week!

You'll notice a few things: \r\n\r\n- Magic Missile is a direct damage ability, it displays your DPS if you were to spam it (factoring in your attack speed), your average hit, and it's normal and crit damage ranges.\r\n- Energy Twister is a DOT type ability, so it's going to show off how much DPS it does, the normal and crit damage range for each tick, and your average tick. \r\n- Energy Armor is a buff, it doesn't show anything special, but has a checkbox in the upper right corner that you can click to activate the buff itself. Once activated, it will apply all of its buff effects to your entire build. The stats panel will change to reflect the buff and any skills it will effect will also update. \r\n\r\nThis allows you to see what the skills the player has chosen actually do to the overall build and stats. Your EHP, DPS, and everything else dynamically change to fit the abilities selected and active. \r\n\r\nAs I said, it's not perfect and there was no way I could possibly check every single combination of skills. So if you find something, hit the feedback button and let me know! I'm assuming that there will be a flood of feedback, and I'll do my best to stay on top and fix them all, but it might take a couple days for me to get around to fixing everything submitted.\r\n\r\nBuild Views and Voting\r\n---\r\n\r\nBrowsing builds on D3Up has been pretty popular, so I wanted to add some mechanics to help the good builds float to the top and gain more exposure! I revamped the bar at the top of the builds, reduced the size of the skills and added in some voting controls.\r\n\r\n**Views** are dynamically updated and logged, you can't simply refresh the page in order to up the view count. Each view of the build is logged and calculated to prevent people from artificially inflating the view number. \r\n\r\nFor **voting**, you **must be logged in to vote**. The mechanics of voting are a lot simpler on my end by requiring the user to be logged in. You are allowed to up vote or down vote on a build, which will either +1 the score or -1 the score, and you can change your vote at any time. If you find a build helpful, awesome or useful, give it an up vote. If a build you found is full of garbage, spam or just not useful at all, down vote it!\r\n\r\nHopefully by allowing everyone to vote on things and by tracking views, as a community, we can let the best builds float to the surface and help new players find useful information. Feel free to post your link to D3Up on your blog and spread the word about your build to get some extra votes/views!\r\n\r\nBuild Browsing Improved\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith votes and views implemented now, I decided to revamp the Build List page a bit as well. You can now sort the builds based on what you are looking for. The following columns are now sortable:\r\n\r\n- Views\r\n- Votes\r\n- Name\r\n- DPS\r\n- EHP\r\n\r\nI also removed the \"Geared\" filter, as now builds that aren't geared up won't show up in the list. Why would you want to see a build that isn't complete? That's my train of thought. \r\n\r\nThe skills displayed on the build page are also now tooltip'd, you can hover over them to see what they are.\r\n\r\nComing Soon - Open Source DPS/EHP Calculator\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm working hard at cleaning up the crappy code in the DPS/EHP Calculator and plan on making it open source and available to anyone that wants to use it. I figure by doing this, it will improve the quality/accuracy of the calculations and allow other sites to use it!\r\n\r\nFew things about the calculator itself:\r\n\r\n- It's written purely in Javascript.\r\n- Currently, it uses underscore.js as it's only dependancy.\r\n- The calculator returns a JS Object containing all of the stats for a build.\r\n- You can pass gear into the calculator in a JSON format.\r\n- The compare tool is integrated into the calculator.\r\n- The code is marked up with more comments than code, to help explain what's going on everywhere.\r\n- I'm not JS Expert, so there's bound to be some \"wtf was he doing here?\" moments.\r\n\r\nI'm not done cleaning it up 100% yet, there's still some sections I want to rewrite before I release it. After the initial wave of bugs and fixing that will go into the Skills Calculator, I plan on returning and finishing the DPS/EHP Calculator and releasing it on github. \r\n\r\nFeedback Widget\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the right side of the page I've added a feedback button. Clicking on it will open up a window that lets you do a few things:\r\n\r\n- Submit Ideas/Bugs/Feedback\r\n- View other peoples Ideas/Bugs/Feedback (and vote on them if you like them!)\r\n- Comment on Ideas/Bugs\r\n\r\nI figure it's a nice way for everyone to submit feedback in one place and help me prioritize what needs to be done!\r\n\r\nIn Closing\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think that's about all I've got for you today. I'm pretty dedicated to the site and hope you are too. I've got a mile long list of things people have requested and things I've considered doing, so there's plenty more updates to come. \r\n\r\nAs I've always said, feel free to reach out to me and let me know what you think, what you want, and how as a community we can improve the site and Diablo 3!\r\n\r\nPS - Think I can claim the title of \"Most Advanced DPS Calculator\" yet? :)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n", "version" : "21 - Skill-based DPS" }

I've got a new build of the \"Item Creator\" that will change how +Min/Max damage on Rings/Amulets/Offhands are parsed and calculated into the builds.

Didn't make much sense, so now YOU get to choose the order!</p>\n\n<p>Another thing you're going to notice is the \"Save\" button at the bottom of the list. Skill's don't save automatically anymore, you have to choose to save them. The reason behind this is two fold:</p>\n\n<ul><li>1) The old method was super unreliable.</li>\n<li>2) I found myself changing my skills to see what would happen, and it would automatically save... so then I had to change it back. I wanted to just SEE what would happen when I changed skills. So now, you can turn skills on and off without it automatically saving them to your build to see what happens.</li>\n</ul><p>The save button also publishes your current DPS/EHP stats to the database. So if you need to update them on the list pages, just hit save on the skills and it will do it for you!</p>\n\n<h2>Item Builder</h2>\n\n<p>I rewrote the Item Builder from the ground up, and you'll notice a few improvements and a few new features. </p>\n\n<p>The first thing I want to point out, if you choose \"Set\" as the quality of the item, another drop down menu will appear that asks you which set this item belongs to. By specifying a set, it will gain the set bonuses from that set, and be factored into your build. Yay, no more plugging those stats in where they shouldn't be!</p>\n\n<p>The second thing is, I've moved as much data into the preview tooltip as humanly possible. Armor on armor pieces, DPS/Damage/Speed on weapons, and Armor/Block Chance/Block Value on shields. Tabbing through the fields should work the same as it always has and hopefully it makes it a little easier to see what goes where. </p>\n\n<p>Next up, +Min/Max damage ranges and +Elemental Damage. I've gotten dozens of emails asking about where to put \"+90-218\" damage for say an offhand, so I wanted to make it more simple. In the attributes selector, you'll now find the following stats:</p>\n\n<ul><li>+Min/Max Damage</li>\n<li>+Min/Max Arcane/Lightning/Fire/Cold/Holy/Poison Damage</li>\n<li>+% Damage</li>\n<li>+% Arcane/Lightning/Fire/Cold/Holy/Poison Damage</li>\n</ul><p>The first two are used for damage ranges, the \"+120-540 Arcane Damage\" or just plain \"+150-300 Damage\". These are the stats you primarily find on Rings/Amulets/Weapons. The second two are used for the \"+3% Damage to Arcane\", like you find on the Tal Rasha's set pieces. I haven't implemented the math yet for elemental damage, but that's coming soon.</p>\n\n<p>The text boxes for the Min/Max fields are a little wider and if the ring says \"+6-12 Damage\", simply put \"<strong>6-12</strong>\" in the textbox for it. Don't add the + or anything else, just the two numbers with a dash between them.</p>\n\n<p>As always, please let me know if you find any bugs! I'll be playing with these changes for the rest of the night and fixing bugs.

You can browse for Guides by the type as well as the class, hopefully helping you find the kinds of information you're interested in.</div><div><br></div><div>Guides can be rated by registered users as well, allowing the best of the bunch to rise to the top.</div><div><br></div><div>Feel free to read on for all the information you'll ever need about creating a guide or get started and&nbsp;<a href=\"/guide/create\">create your own guide</a> to share your strategies!</div></div></div></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" }, { "type" : "generic", "title" : "What's the difference between a build and a guide?", "content" : "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuilds and Guides are related, but not the same thing.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>A <font color=\"#33ccff\"><b>build</b></font>&nbsp;is a combination of your gear and stats, as well as the abilities you use, used to calculate your raw statistics and is related to the character you play.</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, a <b><font color=\"#33ccff\">guide</font></b>&nbsp;is the idea behind why you play with the gear and skills on your build. It also doesn't even have to be directly related to a build, you could create a guide for 'Act 2 - Inferno Speed Farming' &nbsp;that is for anyone playing the game. Guides are completely up to you and your imagination, here's a few examples of guides you could create:</div><div><ul><li>Share your gold making strategies on the AH.</li><li>Map out the most efficient route to farm Act 3.</li><li>Create a guide containing where you should level from 11-18.</li><li>Explain how to Import your D3 Profile from the Armory into a D3Up profile.</li></ul><div>It's really up to you and the rest of the community.

Because of this, you'll definitely want some +pickup radius, ideally around 15 yards or so. This can be done through acquiring 3 items with pickup radius on them, or alternatively you can get Thing of the Deep. That one item will take care of all your grave injustice needs, and is my personal choice.

There are several classes in the game that rely on ranged damage, and this can often result in long kiting battles. Crowd control is often overlooked because it does not increase your DPS on paper, nor does it increase your EHP. The Wall provides a way to slow the enemies' advance so that ranged DPS builds can rain death and destruction over your head without much worry. For this reason, it is primarily a multiplayer build, but it still works extremely well in solo play if you have good equipment (easily farming A3/A4 Inferno, although killing Treasure Pygmies can be difficult due to the complete lack of spike damage). This build also works equally well with other crowd control builds like frozen Wizards; they will love your Wrenching Smash!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t" }, { "type" : "generic", "title" : "Controlling the Flow of Battle", "content" : "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince this is a crowd control build, the most important thing to learn is how to control the flow of battle in order to maximize efficiency.<br><br><u><font size=\"4\">Bottlenecks</font></u><br>A lot of maps in the game have natural bottlenecks, especially the indoor areas of the game. Bottlenecks are places where the natural terrain forces advancing enemies through a narrow opening which is easy to block. If you can find a narrow enough spot, such as a doorway, you can effectively block the entire width of the bottleneck with your big fat barbarian, thus preventing any enemies from getting around you and reaching your allies.<br><br>There's one thing to be aware of when utilizing a bottleneck: Wrenching Smash can actually pull enemies <i>past </i>you if they're close enough when you use the ability. This can cause you to unintentionally pull enemies through to the other side of the bottleneck.<br><br><u><font size=\"4\">The Cycle</font></u><br>Another way to control large crowds when there is no natural bottleneck available is by slowly retreating your front line as you fight. For example, you might initially run straight past the first row of enemies (or what's even more fun is to Leap into the center of a huge group of enemies) and then use Wrenching Smash to pull everything into a tight pile and stun it. You are then free to Rend the pile and start Cleaving it. However, as this goes on, enemies from the rear ranks will continue moving forward and may begin to circle around you and head toward your allies. The Gathering Storm rune for Cleave is good at slowing this advance, but eventually you may get overwhelmed. When this happens, Leap backward so that you're once again facing the enemy front line, and begin Cleaving them from there. By the time they start to overwhelm you a second time, Ground Stomp should be up again and you can repeat the cycle. Doing this you can keep enemies heaped in a nice pile and prevent them from advancing very quickly even in the open battlefield.<br><br><u><font size=\"4\">Stop Running You Bastard!</font></u><br>Ranged attackers are probably the most frustrating enemies for a face-tanking build like The Wall. They run and run, often tempting you to abandon the enemy front line and chase them around. In multiplayer, this is bad. Do not abandon the front line for any reason. Pick the most intimidating group of enemies you can and engage them head-on. Let your allies clean up the outliers. If there are ranged attackers behind the enemy front line chucking spears at you or whatever, just ignore them. You have no choice. Their turn will come once the enemy front line has been adequately decimated.<br><br>Another thing to know about enemies that run away from you is you need to learn to anticipate which direction enemies will run and when. If the enemy's front line has been destroyed and you're just down chasing the runners, then crowd control becomes even more important. For example if an enemy is running away, you can Leap in front of them and they will change direction to run away from you. Often they will run away from the closest player to them, so if you get up in their face you can control which direction they run. You can use this technique to herd them straight back toward your allies so that your allies can tear them up, or you can use it to pin them into a corner where they can't run away. This technique also works well on Treasure Pygmies; while your allies are trying to zerg the pygmy down you can spend your time preventing him from getting very far away. If your allies don't even have to move the whole time, their increased DPS output will more than make up for the fact that you're hardly doing any DPS as you play shepherd.<br><br><u><font size=\"4\">Fire Chains</font></u><br><font size=\"3\">Enemies with fire chains will often try to configure \nthemselves so that they hit you with as many fire chains as possible. \nWhat this usually means is that one of the group will try to get behind you, one will try to move to the opposite side of the first, and the third one will try to stay in front of you, thus creating a triangle with you inside\n it; a \"Triangle of Doom\" as it were.<br><br>If they are willing to get up in your face, and you can survive the fire chains, this can be a great way to activate Revenge to speed up the kill!<br><br>If they're ranged attackers spreading out a lot, or if you can't handle the fire chains, the best thing you can do\n is focus on the one in the pack that's trying to get behind you and \nkeep repositioning so that they can't lock you inside the Triangle of Doom. If he tries to move to your left in order to get around you, \nmirror his movements and go left as well. There will be one taking the lead and one who's not really trying to get behind you but just to your side, so make sure to identify and focus on the one trying to get behind you. Sometimes they will trade \nroles.</font><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" }, { "type" : "generic", "title" : "Equipping Your Wall", "content" : "The basic requirements for The Wall are fairly simple, and in fact, it uses a lot of the same stats most Barbarian builds use with one exception: criticals. Critical hit chance and damage are two extremely popular stats for increasing DPS, and for activating special gimmicks on specific skills such as those whose cooldowns are reduced by crits. The Wall doesn't really benefit from crits in any way except DPS, and in that regard crits are not as valuable to The Wall.<br><br>That's not to say you shouldn't bother with any crit bonuses; Just that you should be more inclined to choose other bonuses first. For example, strength not only adds more DPS, but also increases your armor. Similarly, attack speed not only increases your DPS, but also increases the frequency which you land hits, which means that if you have Life On Hit, it will activate more.<br><br>That being said, the five main stats you are looking for are:<br><ul><li>Strength</li><li>Vitality</li><li>All Resistance</li><li>Life On Hit</li><li>Attack Speed</li></ul>Here's a link to the reference build that was used to create this guide: <a href=\"http://d3up.com/b/5501\">The Wall</a><br><br>For those who are adept at equipping their Barbarian for various builds, this will probably be all you need to know and you can probably skip the rest of this section. For those who aren't, I'll go into a little more detail about specific gear choices.<br><br><u><font size=\"4\">General Rules of Thumb</font></u><br>Armor and Resistance are the two main factors for reducing damage. What many may find counter-intuitive is that armor does, in fact, reduce magic damage. Similarly, \"all resistance\" includes physical resistance, which reduces physical melee damage as well. In other words, these two stats are more or less interchangeable (with 1 resist all being roughly equal to 10 armor), and further, they are multiplicative. So for example, if you have armor that provides 80% damage reduction, and resistance that provides 60% damage reduction, then the net damage taken will be: (1 - 0.80) * (1 - 0.60) = 0.08, in other words you will take 8% damage. If an attack would normally hit you for 1000 damage, you will instead take 80 damage. For this reason, it's usually better to have a balance of the two stats over a lot of one and not much of the other.<br><br>Here are the general values you will need to farm each Inferno act in this build. Note that you can progress with lower stats, but to farm consistently with no deaths, this is roughly what you'll need:<br><br>Act I - 4000 armor, 300 resist all, 30000 life, 7000 DPS<br>Act II - 8000 armor, 600 resist all, 35000 life, 15000 DPS<br>Act III &amp; IV - 10000 armor, 1000 resist all, 40000 life, 22000 DPS<br><br>If you meet these requirements and still struggle to stay alive, then you are probably lacking in life recovery. Do not underestimate the power of life on hit, life steal, or even straight life per second. You should be able to recover at least 3k life per second while attacking for Act III and up, although with good DPS and multiple enemies, Rend can often provide at least half of that. Don't neglect life per second; many people overlook this stat but getting a good 700-1000 of it can make a huge difference.<br><br><u><font size=\"4\">What to Aim for in Specific Slots</font></u><br>Here I'll cover what you should shoot for in specific gear slots, based on what stats are available in those slots and in what ranges.<br><br><b>Weapon</b>: You're looking for a pretty standard weapon, here. One with at least 600 life on hit, or 2.5% life steal, is preferable. Alternately, you can get one with a socket and put an amethyst in it for life on hit. However, it's not mandatory to have life recovery on your weapon if you can get enough from other slots. Sky Splitter and Echoing Fury are the preferred legendaries for this slot, as they both have fast attack speeds and good face-tanking stats. Sky Splitter has 500 life per second and an extra ability to smite enemies, while Echoing Fury has the chance to fear enemies it hits. You might think the fear is a bad thing for melees, but with all the crowd control abilities this build has makes it less of an issue.<br><br><b>Shield</b>: Aim for a <i>minimum </i>of 25% block chance. Absolute bare minimum. Block chance is everything here, which is why Stormshields are a great option as they can block well over 30% of the time. Additional stats to look for are at least 100 Strength, 60 Resist All, and potentially Vitality, Life %, or Crit Chance.<br><br><b>Head</b>: The most important thing here is not to buy a helm without a socket. Always have a socket in your helm, whether you use it for an experience gem, magic find gem, or life % gem. Other things to shoot for are at least 70 Strength, 60 Resist All, and 70 Vitality or some Life %. If you can get a helm with both socket and Life %, that's a really good find. You can also get a little bit of Crit Chance here. If you have a lot of money, an even better option is the Mempo of Twilight legendary which can have all of the above plus up to 9% attack speed. Alternately, if you don't have a Stormshield, or your Stormshield block rate is low, then you might consider a Helm of Command here to increase your block rate.<br><br><b>Amulet &amp; Rings</b>: Amulet and Rings can receive the same stats, so I've grouped them together here. It doesn't matter what stats you get from which of these three slots, as long as the three together provide at least: 300 or so Strength, 150 or so Vitality, 600 or so Life On Hit, and 15% or so Attack Speed. You can forgo some of the attack speed here at your discretion, especially if you prefer a crit-oriented build, just be aware you'll need more life recovery elsewhere to make up for it. Increasing attack speed reduces the amount of Life On Hit you need to survive. As usual, use these slots to cover any shortcomings your other equipment might have.<br><br><b>Shoulders</b>: Aim for good strength, as it's easy to get 200+ strength from shoulders. Good slot to pick up 200-300 life per second, as there isn't much else to aim for here.<br><br><b>Gloves</b>: Aim for a pair with 9% attack speed and some other good stats. They can also get crit chance/damage which boosts DPS nicely, but attack speed is more critical to this build.<br><br><b>Chest</b>: Chest armor can have a lot of vitality and up to 3 sockets, so you can get a lot out of this slot. You can also get over 500 life per second from this slot, as well as over 10% Life bonus.<br><br><b>Belt</b>: You can get some rather unique bonuses on your belt, such as life steal and bonus to Barbarian skills such as Cleave. I'd shoot for something with strength, vitality, resist all, and life steal.<br><br><b>Pants</b>: Pants can have a ton of vitality, so aim for that more than strength here. Very similar to chest armor.<br><br><b>Boots</b>: 12% Movement Speed should not be overlooked. If you can get a legendary like Immortal King's Stride, Fire Walkers, or Ice Climbers, all three are great options. I'd say Ice Climbers are the best match for this build due to the Life+10% they provide, but the Crowd Control Reduction on Immortal King's is also really nice, and of course everyone wants to be molten so the Fire Walkers will always be a popular choice.<br>" }, { "skills" : [ { "skill" : "tough-as-nails", "content" : "" }, { "skill" : "superstition", "content" : "" }, { "skill" : "juggernaut", "content" : "This rune is optional but I personally like having it so that I don't need to run away from frozen orbs and such, which risks breaking the front line you're ever so delicately attempting to maintain.

What is better still is it <em>stack</em>s. As in if you have 1.5aps then you could get 150%LoH/Tick/MoB.</p><p>Acid Cloud - Acid Rain: Huge Aoe doing pretty good damage and&nbsp; to further make you immortal it has 280%LoH at it's core. Great for when you need some hp on the run.</p><p>Soul Harvest - Soul to Waste: The focus of this build is constant damage and for that we need the up to 650 extra int we get from this skill. With any other rune we only have a 15s window to rebuff ourselves which often makes us have to live with only 2-3 souls absorbed or hold off for that big group you *know* is just around the corner. The rune <strong>triples</strong> that window.</p><p>Firebomb - Pyrogeist&nbsp;:&nbsp;This is a fire and forget skill that adds 640% dmg. Almost anyother skill interrupts our PoT - RoT. Those that dont require us to get close to out target (Locust&nbsp;Swarm for example) or are slow and unrliable (Spider Queen I am looking at you). And most of all we have great AoE dmg so some v1/kiting skills are needed for balance.&nbsp;</p><p>Summon Zombie Dogs - Rabid Dogs: Well you need pets. These guys hold MoBs in place and do some damage.&nbsp;They wont be dying much so I went the extra damage.</p><p>Gargantuan - Humongoid: 130% AoE Damage? Yes, please.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the passives well you can read why I choose what I did. Now with this build the goal is to keep the MoBs at bay thanks to your pets while spamming PoT - RoT while keeping all other skills active as much as you can. Why this is such great DPS is in the skills themselves. PoT - RoT gives 130% AoE DPS, The dogs give 27%(+25% DoT)&nbsp;AoEish DPS, AC - AR gives ~88% massive AoE DPS, Firebomb - Pyrogeist&nbsp; gives 104% v1 DPS, and the Gargantuan gives 130% DPS or ~ 497% sustainable DPS.&nbsp; Factor in the 650 additnal int and the +20% damage from Pierce The Veil and you can see why this build is good for farming. And how your pets are made godlike is in the gear (all of mine cost me ~2m and I can farm a4 if I wanted to be an idiot) So on that note I shall explain what you need on gear.</p><p>Weapon - LoH, the more the better. MP regen. That's it, so it should be easy to find +int/+vit/+CD/etc.</p><p>Offhand:</p><p>&nbsp; Mojo - MP regen is the only manditory. I <span style=\"padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 14px;\" sb_id=\"ms__id4983\">recommend this but if you want a sheild...</span></p><p>&nbsp; Sheild - Life Regen and AR.</p><p>All armor save rings and amulets:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Life Regen/AR/+ARMR. This will be the most expensive part if you also want int/cc/ias/cd/vit. For the most part ias&gt;cc&gt;cd&gt;int&gt;vit. Just use commen sense there.</p><p>Rings and Amulets</p><p>&nbsp;By this point you should already be good to go so get what you can. Life Regen/AR/+ARMR/+Vit for def and + int/ias/cc/cd/raw damage for more DPS.

Any questions about skill choices will be placed here in future edits. For now these are the two that I feel are the most commonly used skills that are left out of this build.<div><br></div><div><ul><li><b>Steady Aim:</b>&nbsp;This one I feel is pretty obvious after you've played this style once or twice. Most of your damage is dealt while being in a fairly close proximity to enemies, if not&nbsp;completely&nbsp;surrounded so the bonus from steady aim would only benefit you while kiting with your standard left-click attacks.</li><li><b>Smoke Screen: </b>I initially started running this build with smokescreen lingering fog, but found eventually that 1. It didnt provide a long enough time to get in close, deal damage and then get out again. I also tried running this with the smokescreen poisonous gas rune, and am actually still very open to this idea. However, the very short duration of this skill means you would have very little time to execute a damage combo and then vault to safety again. The real deal sealer for me for shadow power over SS was the lifesteal gained from Gloom</li></ul></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" }, { "type" : "generic", "title" : "Why this build?", "content" : "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI was one of those unfortunate enough to have 3 pieces of the nats set and about 10 mil gold when 1.04 hit. This left me in a really tough position. Either save up for the ridiculously priced natalya's mark, or move on to bigger and better things. So I cut my losses and ditched my below average Natalya's Gaze and bought a shiny new Andariels visage. Netting myself a 7.5k dps boost at the time.<br><br>I was, however, very envious of these demon hunters with their 2 disc/second regen *shakes fist* and the way in which they could spam the new op vault rune. To really use it offensively and regularly, one needs a good discipline income. And as a person in a position without 60mil to fork out for an average-at-best ring, I set my mind to working out another way to get this done, and this build is the result.<br><br>If you don't have 4pc nats and want to be able to spam vault ToC (or any discipline spender, really) this build is for you.<br><br>Here's a link to my profile for reference's sake.&nbsp;\n<a href=\"http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/Moguta-6990/hero/826834\">http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/Moguta-6990/hero/826834</a>.

If you can't survive a few hits with gloom up, this build won't work for you.</li><li>To maximize the damage output from this build, you also want a good sense of timing. For the cooldown of fan of knives, and the duration of shadow power.<br></li><li><b>This is NOT a build for pure glass cannon DH's. You WILL take hits.

I'll go through a few of the skill combinations I use that I feel maximize the damage output of this build.<br><br><ul><li>The standard bursty combo is this; Pop shadow power, vault into a large pack of enemies, fan of knives, multishot once (or twice if you have high attack speed) then vault back out, making sure to cross as many enemies as you can with vault. Kite backwards while generating hatred, use multishot to gain more disc if needed, then repeat when fan of knives comes off cooldown.</li></ul><ul><li>If you are against a small number of melee mobs - you can easily kite them back and forth using just vault, one or two stutter steps away and then vault back through them and repeat. If you vault before they get in melee range to start an attack, they usually wont hit you. Some enemies with fast attack animations will manage a hit. This is just a matter of getting used to which enemies you should use shadow power before moving in close to.</li></ul><ul><li>&nbsp;Big melee pack closing in? Pop shadow power right as they get close, then fan of knives when they have a small surround, attack for as long as shadow power/fan of knives stun will last then vault past them and kite (and then repeat first damage combo if you please : )</li><li>With ranged enemies it's really a matter of just angling your vaults across their path and left clicking them alot. This build probably isn't strongest vs ranged enemies, to be honest, but at least there's less of them in the game then there are melee.</li></ul><br><br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t" }, { "type" : "generic", "title" : "Work in progress.", "content" : "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI could write some more tips/tricks for this guide but I've got some RL things to see to.&nbsp;<br><br>Leave feedback if you please (I plan to post this on /r/diablo when their emergency maintenance is over) , and remember that this is just a representation of my current playstyle and a guideline for all of you to use/change/improve upon!

Although this build can work with weapon/shield or dual-wield, it really shines the most with 2-handers and as such, you should look to invest in a 2-hander for this build.<br><br>Personally, I'm not a fan of slow weapons.&nbsp; Slower attack speeds and slower casting animations can be very detrimental in intense situations.&nbsp; Because of this, I do not recommend going any slower than a 1.00 base weapon.&nbsp; This means no hammers or polearms.&nbsp; Two-handed swords and daibos are the best if you find one with the right stats.<br><br><u><font size=\"5\">Life steal is the most important stat on your weapon.</font></u><font size=\"5\">&nbsp; </font><u><font size=\"5\">Do not buy one without lifesteal.</font><br></u><br>Ideally, you'll want to search for the following parameters on the auction house depending on your budget:<br><br>Critical hit damage: 150+<br>Life steal: 5+<br>Socket: 1<br><br>OR<br><br>Critical hit damage: 150+<br>Life steal: 5+<br>Dexterity: 200+<br><br>As for legendary choices, Warmonger is a GREAT weapon for this build because it innately rolls high lifesteal and attack speed and spawns 2 random mods, which can be a combination of dexterity, socket, and critical hit damage up to around 120% or so.&nbsp; It is also reasonably abundant on the auction house, so finding a good one is easy and prices are relatively cheap.&nbsp; Consider one with at least 100%+ critical hit damage with a socket or dexterity.&nbsp; <br><br>Other legendary choices include Flying Dragon, Inna's Reach, Vigilance, and of course, Skorn.&nbsp; Of these 4, Flying Dragon and Skorn are the best choices because they can roll 2 random mods, while Inna's Reach and Vigilance can only roll 1 random mod.&nbsp; A Flying Dragon with lifesteal + critical damage/socket/dexterity is wonderful, and even more powerful if you get one with critical hit chance to wave of light.&nbsp; A dexterity Skorn with lifesteal is a top choice for those looking to spend significantly more on their weapon.&nbsp; Remember, do NOT buy a weapon without lifesteal.<br><font size=\"6\"><br><b><font size=\"7\">Armor:</font></b></font><br><br>Wave of light has a very weak coefficient (11% per tick, for a total of 33% for each target per cast), which means that life on hit and other proc effects are useless.&nbsp; As always, critical hit, critical hit damage, and attack speed are the best damage stats to have.&nbsp; There is essentially no difference in gearing for armor compared to a standard sweeping winds/thunderclap build aside from life on hit being useless.<br><br>Any legendary or rare with spirit regen is a nice bonus, but should not \nbe overvalued because quickening provides a ton of spirit generation.<br><br>1.0.4 legendaries to consider with relevance to this build:<br><br>Stone of Jordan, Skull Grasp, and Mara's Kaleidoscope with wave of light critical hit chance.&nbsp; SoJ and Mara's can roll up to 7% crit and Skull Grasp can roll up to 6%.&nbsp; While none of the three are crucial, they can be a good alternative to a regular rare ring if you can afford it.<br>" }, { "type" : "generic", "title" : "Followers", "content" : "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith a build that utilizes high spirit generation, the templar follower is now a strong contender to the overused enchantress.&nbsp;

This is slightly different than a \npositional cast because this will always knock them directly away from \nyou.&nbsp; However, unlike the positional cast, this will also follow your \ntarget if your target is fast (soul rippers, for example) or has \nteleport.<br><br>A positional cast is casting it in the direction of \nyour pointer.&nbsp; This is best for when you want to hit two enemies that \nare somewhat apart from each other so that a targeted cast wouldn't hit \nboth of them or knock a target away in a certain direction that's not \ndirectly behind your target.&nbsp; An enemy affected by the main damage will \nalways be knocked away from the center of the bell animation.&nbsp; That \nmeans you can knock enemies to the side with the right casting angle.&nbsp; \nTo avoid accidental targeted casts, you can pull your pointer farther \naway from close quarters, since the spell itself always has the same \nrange regardless of how far your pointer is from your character.<br><br>Knowing when to use which type of casting will maximize your crowd control and damage." }, { "skill" : "mantra-of-conviction~a", "content" : "More damage is always good.&nbsp;

This&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;is generally discouraged on many forums and communities, make sure to follow their rules.</li><li><b>Respond Politely to&nbsp;Criticism</b>&nbsp;- Trolls, there's trolls everywhere. Don't feed them, kill them with kindness. Address their issues in a civil manner and try to start a dialog in public, never ever get involved in a flame war. You'll lose the respect of some by stooping to their level.</li><li><b>Provide Links</b>&nbsp;- Make sure that the readers have links to click on in your posts, sometimes being obvious is not obvious enough. There have been situations where I've made posts, talked about D3Up.com in the content, added D3Up.com to the title and users still ask how to get to the website.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Be Precise </b>- Explain what you are trying to accomplish and don't use terms/lingo that the readers might be unfamiliar with. Make sure that everyone in the world knows what you're trying to explain and the possible benefits.</li><li><b>Keep people Informed</b>&nbsp;- Huge update to your guide? Something pop up in a discussion and you'd like to let everyone know? Provide updates on the posts you've created and engage the people who have participated. The best method I've found is to update the original post and then \"bump\" it with a new post stating you've updated the original.</li></ol><div>If you have any suggestions for more rules, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com\">let me know</a>.</div></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t" }, { "type" : "generic", "title" : "Where should I talk about my guide?", "content" : "There's a lot of places on the internet with talk about Diablo 3, but&nbsp;make sure wherever you are going to post allows these kinds of discussions, you don't want to post it in the wrong place!&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Off the top of my head, there's a number of other sites related to Diablo you could start a discussion about it.</div><div><ul><li><a href=\"http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/\">Diablo 3 Official Forums</a>&nbsp;- Always a good place, but can be extremely hard to have an actual discussion.

Monsters die, pets move on to the next target. In the case of tough affix elites, you may need to retreat if the pets do not hold aggro. Spirit walk back a short ways, have your pets reappear next to you, and then continue as before. <br><br>The most difficult thing to do tends to be avoiding frozen explosions, desecration spots and unlucky vortext/jail situations.

That being said, I already assumed the dogs aura proc nerf.</div><div>-Slow cast times are being buffed.
