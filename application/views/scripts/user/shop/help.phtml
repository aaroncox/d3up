<h3>My Shop - Diablo 3 Sales Tool</h3>
<p>The "My Shop" feature is designed to be a tool that supplements your Diablo 3 Auction House experience. Currently it requires some manual accounting, which will be improved over time with feedback from you and continuous improvements.</p>
<p>To give you an idea about what this tool is and will become, I'll explain why I wanted to create it. I want a resource I can visit that will help me accurately gauge the prices of my AH sales. To do this, first we need some actual real-world transaction history. So to build up this history, I decided to create a tool that would be useful to the end user even if the stats didn't exist, a tool to keep track of your sales history. The added benefit is, as more people use it, more accurate statistics about sales prices can be derived.</p>
<p>The "My Shop" interface currently only lets you create sales for things you have up on the actual Diablo 3 Auction House. You can choose from either the items you've already created (in your builds) or hit the 'Create New Item' button that will guide you through setting up a new item and automatically return you here to sell it when completed.</p>

<p>To start with, we just have a simple table interface to report on data. Over time, this will be expanded into statistics about your sales, regional sales and global sales about items with specific attributes.</p>
<p>When the sale completes, you can either hit the complete button to record how much it sold for or hit the "Didn't Sell" button which will record a failed sale (It's good to figure out how much things DON'T sell for too). It will keep track of the completed/failed sales, as well as the attributes on the items.</p>

<p>After you've build up a sales history, the statistics tab will start populating data based on your sales. Currently it will list sales by date in a table, with some overall statistics above it.</p>

<p>I'm not a huge statistics person, but I'd be interested in hearing what kind of data you'd like to see and how it could become useful. Feel free to contact me (<a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>) if you're interested in coming up with some useful reports or statistics! :)</p>
