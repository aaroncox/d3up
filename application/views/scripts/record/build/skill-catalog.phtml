	<p style="padding: 0 10px">This page shows all of your skills WITHOUT a cooldown, along with their DPS (Damage per Second), LPS (Life per Second, LS + LOH + Regen), and any Resource generation that may be part of the ability. Much of this data hasn't been tested yet, but I'm making it available for feedback.</p>
