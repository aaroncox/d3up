<h5>Sync Character with Battle.net Profile</h5>
<div class="form">
	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #d00'>Issues with Battle.net - Please Read</h3>
	Since sometime on Friday (the 15th), the Battle.net API has been acting strange. Requests for characters and items (non 1.0.7 related) are failing. I've contacted Blizzard about it and hopefully they'll have it resolved soon. Because of this, the build creator <strong><u>may not find your characters</u></strong>.
<? if($this->record->_characterBt && $this->record->_characterRg && $this->record->_characterId): ?>
  <? if(!$this->record->_createdBy->id): ?>
    <h3>This is an anonymous build</h3>
    <p>This build was created by someone who wasn't logged in and just wanted to import their character. No edits can be made to the gear/skills on this build, the only way to change it is to resync with Battle.net. </p>
  <? endif ?>
  <p>This Build uses the following character:</p>
  <div class='notice'><a href="<?= D3Up_Tool_Crawler::makeUrl($this->record->_characterRg, $this->record->_characterBt, $this->record->_characterId) ?>"><?= $this->record->_characterBt ?> <br/> Character ID #<?= $this->record->_characterId?></a></div>
  <a class="button" href="/b/<?= $this->record->id ?>/resync">Resync ALL Data from Battle.net</a>
  <a class="button" href="/b/<?= $this->record->id ?>/resync/only/skills">Resync JUST SKILLS from Battle.net</a>
  <a class="button" href="/b/<?= $this->record->id ?>/resync/only/items">Resync JUST ITEMS from Battle.net</a>
  <? if($this->record->_createdBy->id): ?>
    <p>You may sync your profile once every (2) minutes by clicking the button above.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to change which character this build is sync'd with, feel free to use the button below to sync one of your other characters. I'd recommend against it, normally you should just create a new build, but if you need to correct the character, feel free.</p>
    <a class="button" href="/b/<?= $this->record->id ?>/crawl">Specify which Character to Sync</a>
  <? else: ?>
    <p>You may sync your profile once every (1) hour by clicking the button above.</p>
    <p>Want to create a build of your own?</p>
    <a class='button' href='/build/create'>Create a new Build</a>
  <? endif ?>
<? else: ?>
  <p>We aren't sure which character you used to sync this build with the first time. This is most likely due to the character not being sync'd in a while.</p>
  <p>Please use the button below and pick which character you'd like to sync this build with from here on out.</p>
