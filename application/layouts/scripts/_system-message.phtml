	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #0d0'>Group/Party Buffs Tab</h3>
	There's a new tab on your build, it's for all the buffs that your fellow players can buff you with. Hit the tab and you can activate all the buffs from other classes. See one missing? Email me.
	If something seems wrong, please let me know at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.
