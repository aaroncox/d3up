	<h3 style='margin: 0'>Notice: Armory Profiles updating Irregularly</h3>
	Just wanted to let you know there's some strange things happening on the armory since 1.0.5. Hellfire rings don't show on characters and character's are updating really slowly. This isn't an issue with D3Up, it's an armory issue!
	Please report any bugs via the feedback tab or email me at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.
