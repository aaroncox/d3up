	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #0d0'>Happy Holidays!</h3>
	It's been a great half year now working on D3Up, you've all been incredible and provided some amazing feedback. Here's to you and hoping you have a great holiday season to wrap up the year!
	I'm going to be taking it easy for the next couple weeks and will be trying to keep myself away from work. 
	Still, if something seems wrong, please let me know at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.
