	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #0d0'>D3Up V2 - Feature Preview #2</h3>
	Over the next month or two, I'm going to be previewing features on <a href='http://reddit.com/r/d3up'>/r/d3up on reddit</a>, 
	with #2 being shown off today! <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/d3up/comments/1brecl/new_feature_2_build_comparisons_in_d3upcom_v2/'>Build Comparisons</a> is going to be a new way to compare your build with another to see what makes each build tick.
	Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a> to report any bugs.
