	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #d00'>Battle.net Sync Issues</h3>
	Not sure what's going on, but the Battle.net API isn't responding properly to the D3Up requests. The API is being throttled, D3Up is being blocked, or the server is hitting a bad API mirror or something. I've emailed Blizzard to check on it. 
	Anything else please use the feedback tab or email me at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.
