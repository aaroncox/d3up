	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #d00'>Battle.net Sync Issues</h3>
	Not sure what's going on, but the Battle.net API isn't responding properly to the D3Up requests. The API is being throttled, D3Up is being blocked, or the server is hitting a bad API mirror or something. I've emailed Blizzard to check on it. 
	Anything else please use the feedback tab or email me at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.

	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #0d0'>Group/Party Buffs Tab</h3>
	There's a new tab on your build, it's for all the buffs that your fellow players can buff you with. Hit the tab and you can activate all the buffs from other classes. See one missing? Email me.
	If something seems wrong, please let me know at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.
