	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #d00'>New BoA Items and Marquise Gems not syncing properly</h3>
	It's come to my attention that the new BoA items (some?) are not syncing properly, and the new Marquise Gems aren't showing up on items either. I've contacted Blizzard regarding these issues and will keep you posted! I also posted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/d3up/comments/18dtlq/d3upcom_v107_and_future_plans/">a long update on /r/d3up</a> about the site and 1.0.7 updates. If you find any issues with the new gems, please <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">sent me an email</a> with a link to your build!

	Since sometime on Friday (the 15th), the Battle.net API has been acting strange. Requests for characters and items (non 1.0.7 related) are failing. I've contacted Blizzard about it and hopefully they'll have it resolved soon.
