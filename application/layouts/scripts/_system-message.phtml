	I really am enjoying the public interaction and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/d3up">discussion happening on /r/d3up</a>, it just feels a bit more organized than the feedback tab on the site. Feel free to head over and report bugs, suggest features or just talk about d3up in general.
	If something seems wrong, please let me know at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.
