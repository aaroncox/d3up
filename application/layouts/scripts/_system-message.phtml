	Been a bit quiet on the update front, because I've been busy working on D3Up V2. It's a complete revamp of the site with a TON of new features, including multi-language support, mobile friendly design and much more. I'm still in the boring part of development, but expect previews soon and a spring/summer launch!
	Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a> to report any bugs.
