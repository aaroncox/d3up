	You'll notice the little search box below this message to the right. You can use it to search for public builds associated to a specific battle tag. You'll find any build imported by any user with that specific tag (so there may be dupes).
	If something seems wrong, please let me know at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.
