	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #d00'>Battle.net Sync Issues</h3>
	Not sure what's going on, but the Battle.net API isn't responding properly to the D3Up requests. The API is being throttled, D3Up is being blocked, or the server is hitting a bad API mirror or something. I've emailed Blizzard to check on it. 
	Anything else please use the feedback tab or email me at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.

	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #0d0'>An easy to remember link to all your builds (to share)</h3>
	You can link someone quickly to all of your builds now like this: <a href="http://d3up.com/tag/jesta-1121">http://d3up.com/tag/jesta-1121</a>. Just remember that it's just /tag/ + your BattleTag, with a - instead of a #. It will not show builds you mark as private.
	If something seems wrong, please let me know at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.
