	<h3 style='margin: 0; color: #0f0'>Survey: Help shape the future of D3Up.com!</h3>
	I've created <a href="http://survey.greymass.com/index.php/survey/index/sid/351896/lang/en">a 2 question survey</a>, short and simple, and want to get feedback from all of you about D3Up! Also <span style="color: #f00">Hellfire Rings still will not sync</span>, it's a problem on Blizzard's end, not mine.
	Please report any bugs via the feedback tab or email me at <a href="mailto:aaron.cox@greymass.com">aaron.cox@greymass.com</a>.
